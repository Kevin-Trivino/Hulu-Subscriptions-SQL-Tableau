## Summary of Insights

### Plan Type
-  The No ads plan brings in the most sales, accounting for nearly 50% of the sales revenue through those two years.
-  Note that Live TV makes up the second highest percentage of sales, and it was only recently introduced in 2017.

### Plan Period
- Annual plans are much more popular than monthly plans, and this is expected as it is cheaper over the long term for users who plan to remain subscribed for at least a year.

### Plan Region
- The Northeast and South regions make up around 70% of total subscription sales, with the Midwest making up the least, as expected since it has a much lower population count than the other regions. 

### Recommendations and Next Steps
- Hulu + Live TV was introduced in 2017 and now brings in the second highest proportion of subscription sales, beating out the basic plan. This signals that users may have an increased interest in Live TV services from Hulu and not just their streaming content. Possibly capitalize on this by including new live TV bundles with channels specific to certain categories, such as sports, to win over customers who may be interested in a Live TV bundle but do not want to pay the increased price for live channels they dont use. Conduct research on which Live TV channels are most popular among specific demographics and include more options for Live TV content. 
- Annual plans make up much more than monthly subscriptions. This is likely not an area that needs improvement, as it is beneficial to have users subscribe to the annual plan to have them as longer term customers and lock in their subscription payments.
- For the regions with lower sales, specifically the Midwest, efforts can be focused here to increase market penetration. For example, create campaigns tailored to the preferences in that specific region.
- When looking at the overall sales throughout the year, there do not appear to be any notable trends. Perhaps look into the months with the highest and lowest subscription sales for each dimension and identify any differences that may have led to this, such as changes in plan price, newly added or removed shows, etc.
